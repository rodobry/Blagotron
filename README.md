Hey! I'm your first Markdown document in **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

Features
-------------

StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

> **Note:**

> - StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
> - Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
> - Clearing your browser's data may **delete all your local documents!** Make sure your documents are synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** (check out the [<i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronization](#synchronization) section).
